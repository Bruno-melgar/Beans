- **Description:** <br/>	
This dataset contains the data collected from the experimental test performed in beans and rice flours applying different microorganisms strains in a Solid State Cultivation. In this study, we performed different machine learning and multivariate analysis focused in the main nutrient-enrichment of the by-products. Evaluating with different approaches like clustering and PCA, and selecting the better combination regarding the m.o. performance.
